# Python for Data Science and Machine Learning
Machine learning using SP901 dataset

1. Using the dataset provided, create a binary classification
2. Perform the following:
    *  Perform an exploratory analysis (scaling, PCA, unbalanced)
    *  Split the data (train, validation, test)
    *  Perform 10-fold cross-validation and grid search (method of your choice)
    *  Compare the different classification methods
        (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, RF, XGBOOST)
    *  Show evaluation metrics (ROC-AUC, accuracy, f-1 score)
    *  Submit the jupyter notebook
